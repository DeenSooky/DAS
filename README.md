Lab1Prep & Lab2Prep
- Investigated waveforms related to pulse width modulation and quadrature encoding by connecting diverse signal sources and sensors to 
  the Arduino Mega 2560 using different peripheral boards.
- Developed code using the C language and applied it to an Arduino application.
- Successfully interfaced a servo motor, an incremental encoder, an H bridge, an LS7366R up/down counter, and the Arduino.
 
Designing a thrust reverser actuation system lock (TRASL) using Solidworks
- Designed a versatile and compatible 3D model of a Thrust Reverser Actuation System Lock (TRASL) with provisions for locking 
  actuators and the third lock.
- Engineered the TRASL device to withstand challenging scenarios, ensuring a robust maximum torque of 120 Nm in case of failure.
- Targeted a total weight of 3 kg (without fluids), while maintaining manoeuvrability with a maximum limit of 3.5 kg.
- Implemented reserve stress factors set at a minimum of 1.5 to enhance user safety.
- Facilitated ease of maintenance by using M6 x 20 Aerospace Waspalloy fasteners to attach the TRASL unit to Locking Actuators and the 
  Third Lock.
- Ensured additional stability by utilizing M5 fasteners for other parts of the TRASL..

Backtesting algorithmic trading strategies
- Developed three trading strategies for backtesting against daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes.
- Utilized the backtesting library to perform backtests on extracted data from the Alpha Vantage API for the Nike stock, spanning from 
  1999 to the present day.
- Presented the backtesting results as a Pandas dataframe, showcasing various financial metrics such as final equity and win/loss 
  ratio.
- Plotted the results as graphs to provide visual aids for better analysis and interpretation.

Simple_bot
- Developed a simulation of a cleaning robot system using Python and the Tkinter library.
- Implemented multiple bots as blue polygons on a canvas, with behaviors like random wandering, turning, and moving towards charging 
  stations when their battery is low.
- Designed classes for Counter, Bot, Charger, WiFiHub, and Dirt, representing different elements in the simulation and their 
  functionalities.
- Used the Counter class to keep track of collected dirt by the bots and displayed the count on the canvas.
- Created methods within the Bot class for drawing, moving, sensing charging stations, calculating distances, and collecting dirt.
- Generated random positions for charging stations and dirt on the canvas.
- Developed functions for handling button clicks, initializing the canvas, and running the simulation with the desired number of bots.
- Executed the simulation by calling the runOneExperiment function to observe the bots' movement, dirt collection, and interaction 
  with charging stations.

Air conditioning and refrigeration report 
- Conducted an experiment to study air conditioning processes and analyze moisture and heat content indicators in the surrounding air.
- Utilized a psychrometric chart to examine air energy and absolute humidity and a p-h diagram to investigate refrigerant energy 
  change in the cooling heat exchanger.
- Analyzed experimental data and compared it with theoretical data, identifying discrepancies between the two datasets.
- Noted the most significant deviation at point C, representing the cooling of temperature bulbs after initial heating.

Numerical Methods (NM)
- Developed a finite-volume computer modeling technique in MATLAB.
- Applied the technique to solve the steady-state 1D heat conduction equation.
- Utilized specific boundary conditions during the modeling process.

Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- Constructed a finite element model of a notched, circular cross-section bar.
- Analyzed the component's stress distribution under the influence of a nominal axial stress.
- Utilized finite element analysis techniques to perform the stress analysis.

Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
- Generated a refined mesh for an aerofoil case, considering boundary conditions for accurate simulations.
- Utilized the refined mesh to perform numerical simulations and calculate lift and drag forces experienced by the aerofoil.
- Presented the results as a contour plot to visualize the distribution of lift and drag forces on the aerofoil surface.
