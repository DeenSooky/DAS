# DAS

<---Software project DAS------>
The goal is to read data from two files, "ShapeStrokeData.txt" and "DrawShapes.txt," which contain information on shapes and drawing instructions respectively. 
The software should read the data from these files, process it, and send commands in the form of G-Code to the Arduino to control the drawing arm and produce drawings on a grid. The size of the shapes should be 20mm high. 
The user should be able to input the filename for the drawing instructions. The software should be able to handle multiple sets of shapes from different instruction files in the same grid. The pen should finish in the pen-up position.
 
 <-----Lab1PrepDAS & Lab2PrepDAS------->
 Investigated waveforms associated with pulse width modulation and quadrature encoding in by connecting various signal sources and sensors to the Arduino Mega 2560 using different peripheral boards. 
 Additionally, writing code using the C language and applying it to an application with the Arduino. 
 Furthermore, interfacing of a servo motor, an incremental encoder, an H bridge, an LS7366R up/down counter, and the Arduino.
 
 <-------Designing a thrust reverser actuation system lock (TRASL) using Solidworks----------->
  Designed a 3D model of a Thrust Reverser Actuation System Lock (TRASL) that had been carefully designed to achieve versatility and compatibility with both locking actuators and the third lock. 
 The TRASL device had been engineered to withstand even the most challenging scenarios, with the maximum torque set at a robust 120 Nm in the event of a failure. The total weight of the TRASL, without fluids, is targeted at 3 kg, with a maximum limit of 3.5 kg to maintain the unit's manoeuvrability. The reserve stress factors had been set at a minimum of 1.5, providing an extra layer of safety for the user.
 For ease of maintenance, the TRASL unit could be attached to the Locking Actuators and Third Lock using M6 x 20 Aerospace Waspalloy fasteners, with the minimum size of any other fasteners set at M5 for added stability.
